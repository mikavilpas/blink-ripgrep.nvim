Ripgrep source for the [blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp)
completion plugin. Adding it to your configuration offers matching words from
your entire project as completions. This can reduce the chance of typos as well
as repetitive typing.

Forked here (mikavilpas/blink.cmp) for my own use from
[niuiic/blink-cmp-rg.nvim](https://github.com/niuiic/blink-cmp-rg.nvim).

## üì¶ Installation

The configuration of blink-ripgrep needs to be embedded into the configuration
for blink. Example for [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/):

```lua
-- NOTE: you can leave out the type annotations if you don't want to use them

---@module "lazy"
---@type LazySpec
return {
  "saghen/blink.cmp",
  dependencies = {
    "mikavilpas/blink-ripgrep.nvim",
    -- üëÜüèªüëÜüèª add the dependency here
  },
  ---@module 'blink.cmp'
  ---@type blink.cmp.Config
  opts = {
    sources = {
      completion = {
        enabled_providers = {
          -- NOTE: blink >v0.7.6 has moved
          -- `sources.completion.enabled_providers` to `sources.default`
          "lsp",
          "path",
          "snippets",
          "buffer",
          "ripgrep", -- üëàüèª add "ripgrep" here
        },
      },
      providers = {
        -- üëáüèªüëáüèª add the ripgrep provider config below
        ripgrep = {
          module = "blink-ripgrep",
          name = "Ripgrep",
          -- the options below are optional, some default values are shown
          ---@module "blink-ripgrep"
          ---@type blink-ripgrep.Options
          opts = {
            -- For many options, see `rg --help` for an exact description of
            -- the values that ripgrep expects.

            -- the minimum length of the current word to start searching
            -- (if the word is shorter than this, the search will not start)
            prefix_min_len = 3,

            -- The number of lines to show around each match in the preview
            -- (documentation) window. For example, 5 means to show 5 lines
            -- before, then the match, and another 5 lines after the match.
            context_size = 5,

            -- The maximum file size of a file that ripgrep should include in
            -- its search. Useful when your project contains large files that
            -- might cause performance issues.
            -- Examples:
            -- "1024" (bytes by default), "200K", "1M", "1G", which will
            -- exclude files larger than that size.
            max_filesize = "1M",

            -- The casing to use for the search in a format that ripgrep
            -- accepts. Defaults to "--ignore-case". See `rg --help` for all the
            -- available options ripgrep supports, but you can try
            -- "--case-sensitive" or "--smart-case".
            search_casing = "--ignore-case",

            -- (advanced) Any additional options you want to give to ripgrep.
            -- See `rg -h` for a list of all available options. Might be
            -- helpful in adjusting performance in specific situations.
            -- If you have an idea for a default, please open an issue!
            --
            -- Not everything will work (obviously).
            additional_rg_options = {},
          },
        },
      },
      keymap = {
        ["<c-g>"] = {
          function()
            -- invoke manually, requires blink >v0.7.6
            require("blink-cmp").show({ sources = { "ripgrep" } })
          end,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## üèÅ Performance

Depending on the size of your project and your computer's specifications, the
search can be fast or slow. Here are a few things you can do to improve
performance:

- Set the `prefix_min_len` option to a larger number avoid starting a search for
  very short words. This can prevent unnecessary searches and improve
  performance.
- Use the `max_filesize` option to exclude large files from the search. This can
  prevent performance issues when searching in projects with large files.
- If you still experience performance issues, please open an issue for
  discussion.

### Automatic mode

In this mode, the search starts automatically when typing a word that is at
least `prefix_min_len` in length.

This is enabled by including the `ripgrep` provider in blink-cmp's providers:

```lua
return {
  -- ... other configuration
  ---@module 'blink.cmp'
  ---@type blink.cmp.Config
  opts = {
    sources = {
      completion = {
        enabled_providers = {
          -- NOTE: blink >v0.7.6 has moved
          -- `sources.completion.enabled_providers` to `sources.default`
          "lsp",
          "path",
          "snippets",
          "buffer",
          "ripgrep", -- üëàüèª including this enables automatic search
        },
      },
    }
  }
}
```

### Manual mode

If you prefer to start the search manually, you can use a keymap to invoke the
search. The example configuration includes a keymap that invokes the search when
pressing `Ctrl+g`.
